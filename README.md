# Invite Only
Enables your Elgg website to be Invite Only using the core module Invite Friend. 

Disable this plugin to disable the functionality. That's it.

User registration must be enabled and it's nice to have the Invite Friend module enabled. If you didn't enable this module, users aren't able to invite other users, which is required for registration..
